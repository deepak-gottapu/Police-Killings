Analyzing Police killings in US

Due in part to recent high-profile shootings of civilians by police in the US, the media and public have been scrutinizing police killings heavily. If you browse social media and news sites, you may get the sense that there's been a large uptick in civilian shootings by police in the US.

The team at FiveThirtyEight assembled a dataset using crowdsourced data and census data. It contains information on each police killing in the US. This project is an attempt to explore various columns in the dataset to get a better understanding of the facts behind those shootings.
